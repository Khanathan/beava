# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Events go in, features come out — synchronously, in one request-response cycle, with sub-millisecond latency and zero external dependencies.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Engine)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-09 — Roadmap created, milestone v1.0 initialized

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Use AHashMap (not std HashMap) from day one — SipHash 20-25% CPU overhead at 100K+ events/sec
- Init: Use SystemTime (not Instant) for window buckets — client-supplied Unix timestamps must be comparable
- Init: Use postcard (not bincode) for snapshots — bincode has RUSTSEC-2025-0141 advisory, unmaintained
- Init: Implement HyperLogLog directly in hll.rs — external crates require nightly or are minimally maintained
- Init: Use winnow for expression parser — evolved from nom, inline combinators, no grammar files

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5: HLL epoch-based rotation memory math needs validation before implementation (N buckets x 12KB x key count). Add a spike task at Phase 5 start.
- Phase 5: Cross-key lookup semantics when target key has been TTL-evicted must be specified precisely (Missing propagation expected, not panic).
- Phase 2: REGISTER command access control — should REGISTER be restricted to HTTP port (6401) only? Confirm before Phase 2 implementation.
- Phase 4: Snapshot memory approach — clone-then-spawn_blocking creates up to 2x peak memory. Decide between clone approach and chunked cooperative yielding before Phase 4.
