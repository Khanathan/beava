//! IoBackend trait abstraction (Plan 18-05).
//!
//! Abstracts the polling primitive used by per-worker continuous-loop workers.
//! The two concrete implementations are:
//!  - `MioBackend`: uses `mio::Poll` + `mio::Waker` (macOS kqueue, Linux epoll)
//!  - `IoUringBackend`: uses `io_uring` submission/completion queues (Linux only,
//!    feature-gated behind `--features io-uring`)
//!
//! # Per-worker model (Valkey 8 architecture)
//!
//! Each worker thread owns one `IoBackend` instance. The backend owns the
//! polling fd, the waker, and the per-client connection state. Workers run a
//! continuous loop:
//! ```text
//! loop {
//!     drain new_client_rx → backend.add_client(...)
//!     drain write_rx      → backend cache write_buf for each slot
//!     backend.poll(Some(LONG_TIMEOUT), &mut events)
//!     for ev in events {
//!         Readable(s)  → backend.read(s, &mut buf) → parse → read_tx.send(RingItem)
//!         Writable(s)  → backend.write(s, &write_buf[s])
//!         Closed(s)    → backend.close(s)
//!         Sentinel     → continue (re-drain channels)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Apply thread sends to workers via `new_client_tx[w]` and `write_tx[w]`,
//! then calls `waker.wake()` to interrupt `poll()`.
//!
//! # Module naming note
//!
//! The submodule is named `mio_backend` (not `mio`) to avoid shadowing the
//! `mio` crate dependency within this module's namespace.
